275852,"​​🔜.Bracketchain is a new exciting technology that is somewhat similar to blockchain technology but utilizes reflective holographic imagery to validate transactions. Bracketchain actually utilizes a holographic ledger to process transactions nearly at light speed in comparison to traditional blockchains like Bitcoin Ethereum and Binance. Bracketchains technology basically changes the way how a traditional blockchains validate transactions from changing the speed of transactions from processing speed to imagery speed by utilizing web 3.0 photo technology and Bracketchains holograhicledger. The sturcture of the Bracketchain is similar to blockchain but with more comfort for the system to operate at an optimal speed, let me explain. Similar to blockchain Bracketchain has a set number of nodes that are referred to as Virtual banks. The first layer of Bracketchain is activated when the Virtual Banks begin to communicate similar to nodes, the difference is every Virtual Bank has a holographinc version of the entire NFT and cryptographic hash which is referred to as cash. They communicate through a set of reflections which is creating a digital hologram confrimed by every Virtual bank all at once in an instant through a complicated set of algorythims to validate updates to the holographic ledger. New Cash (hash) is then deposited in the digital hologramsa new update is needed then the cycle starts again and confirmed instantly.  🔶 Token Information:  Token Name:     BCK Token Type:       BEP20 Binance Token Price:      1 BNB = ~700 BCK Total Supply:     21,000,000 BCK  🔶 BRACKET COIN is carrying out a Pre-Sale at the moment.

275867,"Shot over 35 days on the streets of Peckham in the U.K., KevCoin: The Movie is filmed in a mockumentary style, with many real people playing themselves and being co-opted into the film. The plot centers around Kevin Powder as he attempts to build his own cryptocurrency, which he can use to fund his latest movie idea and boost its reputation.Attar told Bitcoin Magazine,  “This is the second of three films. We want the next film to be shot in Detroit, where Kevin finds real people to create the world’s biggest crypto-party to end all parties. We will only do this if we find suitable cash resources to film the project. Ideally, the funds will come from how we develop KevCoin in the future, and possibly doing some kind of fundraising involving our token.”Indeed, lead actor Attar is already looking ahead to the next movie in the series. “We do, in fact, have one very strong idea around this already, and depending on the success of this project, we could possibly start this next phase in 2019. It is all dependent on making KevCoin: The Movie work and learning from it. We’re merely experimenting at this point, but we will start to firm up our plans in the near future for a platform that connects audiences to independent films in a social way.”KevCoin: The MovieThe story begins when Kevin’s girlfriend, Bianca, finally breaks it off after months of instability. Finding himself in between homes and looking to start fresh, Kevin gets his hands on a small camper van and heads out to the nearby city of Peckham, a gritty southeast region of London stuffed with nightclubs, bars and other seedy hangouts. During this time, Kevin decides to take his love of science fiction to a new level by creating his own fantasy film, which he’ll call The Day Peckham Stood Still. Unfortunately, the movie industry is tougher than it looks, and not everyone’s enthused by his idea, leaving Kevin to find a new route to fund his project.

Trying to go shopping on this subject was very depressing -- in my favorite Zara everything is weird, there are two and a half velvet things in Mango (and they're not the same), a Topshop jacket didn't sit down on me. I was already desperate, but the guys at the boo store sent me their velvet dress for a review. Luckily, or unfortunately, I'm not an Insta-girl who's desperate for everything she gets into her hands -- I've got everything from my heart and kidneys, as they say -- but the dress that I've been looking for -- a beautiful, complex color, sitting on the figure -- it's made of quality.

It's my custom to take out the emoji, because the boys don't like them very much.   First, a little lyrical retreat: I've got men I know, and many of them think that warm shoes are for the weak. Maybe if you're only moving by car. But in any case, at least buy some furs in your cold shoes. No one needs health problems, right?   One more thing. I don't insist, but it would be better if your winter shoes were just above the ankle. I don't want the snow to fall asleep.   Materials: Skin (better natural), tarpaulin. I don't recommend it. It can crack on the cold. And do not forget the provision of shoes.  Before buying winter shoes, appreciate your way of life. And you're gonna decide how you're gonna dress more often, sports day by day or more classically. That's what we're gonna do: the main styles that fit the sports-time style: • the Timberlands (and everything they look like). By the way, they're not only beige-coloured (like a picture up on the left), they're black, for example.  • fur sneakers. Because the manufacturers of sports shoes love us.  • Martins-like shoes (maybe the martins themselves are in the picture on the left downstairs with a yellow loop).  • Army-style shoes. with the minimum amount of fermentation. It's like a picture upstairs on the right.   The main styles that fit the classical style (with jeans can also be): • classical boots on cords. Note that they sometimes have lightning on the side — with a strict classical costume — that looks strange.  • Chicks. They're such tall boots with no bandages on their sides. They look better with a little baked trousers/ jeans.  Classical shoe nuances: Black boots fit a strict dress code. The brown ones are for more relaxed classical images. Perforation (as in a picture with three pairs of identical boots) is for stylists.   They asked me about the men's uggies. Yes, sir. Of course I don't mind. But if she had seen her husband in them, she would have cut off his legs. That's the positive note I've decided to end up on.",2

But many shoe stamps try to make sculptors with different pads. For different clients. So now every man has a chance to find his perfect pair of shoes. But you have to measure. It's a lot to measure.  2. It is pointless to look for winter shoes in a mass market. this is such a sad and short point.   Now about trends: 1. length of tibia: half boots; boots that end exactly under the knee; botforts; 2. heel: square, stable. Any height. In fashion, interesting transparent heels and heels with metal glitter (but it's all for an amateur, of course); 3... nose shape: look at the picture, I've tried to include different options in it; 4.. materials: colour lock at the peak of popularity (flower options: brown, potter's clay colour, wine, dark green, dark blue, deep gray). Snake and leopard Prince materials. Lacquer is fashionable, but I don't recommend it for the winter. (I already wrote that he could crack on the cold.) And the usual smooth skin wasn't canceled; 5. decor: the best decor is the absence of the decor (I'm not joking). If you wish, you can experiment with heels (para. 2). in fashion active decor with embroidery or crystals (but it's for desperate fashion women).   Sports boots/brutal boots also exist. I'm gonna write about women's uggies that I don't wear them myself, but if I see a girl in neat short uggs, five out of ten times I'm not gonna faint.   And you know I like more than dressing up.

276010,"The question from the reader is: ""Inspired by your last post. And now I want to give my girlfriend an ornament on March 8th. I don't think it's good enough to give you a jewelry, I don't make any money yet, and I've already given Pandora. I'd appreciate it if you could tell me where you can buy beautiful jewelry at a normal price. And it'll be great if you write a couple of advices of your choice.""  I say, first of all, the advice of choice: 1. Remember which jewelry a girl wears more often — gold or silver, with or without stones. This will help to determine the future; 2. The simplest option is suspension or brooch. 'Cause there's no way to guess with size; 3. it's pretty dangerous to get rings: if you're not married, there might be a conflict, and there might be a big/small ring (but there's a genre of a regulated ring); 4. Even if you think that giving an ornament in a velvet box in the form of a red rose is a great idea, don't do it. For me, the best way to get an ornament is to ask a girl to close her eyes and just put it on her.   where to buy: there are now many brands that make cute and cheap jewelry of gold, silver, bronze, or brass. Many of them are on the Lambada Market website (there's been a lot of crap lately, but you can choose the good ones) and in Saharka. links to sites and collections more or less win-win options:   ",2

But in this fuss, you have to remember to dress up for New Year's Eve:) I'll start with men, I think I know two main men's reasons for buying a suit — prom and wedding. What do you do if the prom is long gone and the weddings aren't scheduled? That's right! I'm gonna give myself a New Year's costume. Let's just have it. I've just had a friend buy a fracco, just to be (a great man's stunt, I think). The only requirement for pants is that they sit well (always warning that dozens of models will need to be measured). And the jacket's gonna have to be beautiful as well. If the dress code of the event allows, you do not have to wear a shirt and tie/butt with a costume.  You can wear a diver (especially looks good with two-bore jackets) or a T-shirt (why not?).   If the suit is for you, buy a jacket. Anything interesting, invoiced. The most universal models are Tweed (this jacket can be easily adapted to your daily wardrobe in the future because it looks great with almost everything). Make a holiday look with a jacket based on the format of the event. Possible options include: •pidge + bracelets + chops + balls / butterfly + bots; • pijac + bracelets/ jeans + bots/cooks; • pijac + bracelets/ jeans + water-+bots/cades; • pijac+brooks/ jeans + hoods + kettles.   If you don't want to have fun in your jacket, take a good look at the vests. You can wear them in the same combination as your jackets.   It's also possible to create a stylish image with a sweater or a bullet:)",2

276265,"🔰What Is Zero-Day?🔰  🌀The term “zero-day” refers to a newly discovered software vulnerability. Because the developer has just learned of the flaw, it also means an official patch or update to fix the issue hasn’t been released. So, “zero-day” refers to the fact that the developers have “zero days” to fix the problem that has just been exposed — and perhaps already exploited by hackers.  Once the vulnerability becomes publicly known, the vendor has to work quickly to fix the issue to protect its users. But the software vendor may fail to release a patch before hackers manage to exploit the security hole. That’s known as a zero-day attack.",1

276345,"Figure 1: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, Symmetrical Triangle Breakdown The implications of this consolidation pattern breaking down have potentially devastating ramifications for the crypto market across the board. With patterns like a symmetrical triangle, there is a measured move that will give insight into a potential price target that will play out upon the breakout. In our case the measured move is a staggering $5,500 move. If the triangle had broken to the top, we could have expected to see a $5,500 move to the top. However, since we broke to the bottom of this pattern, we could potentially be heading for prices ranging from $1,500 - $3,000. Whether that target becomes fully realized remains to be seen, but those prices are not out of the question.When we look at current support levels that may impede the downward motion, a few tests need to be broken before the full-fledged bearish pressure really begins to manifest in the market. Our previous low at $6,450 was the lower boundary of an accumulation trading range that caused the market to make a very sizeable rally, testing the $10,000 range. Breaking this price level would undoubtedly send a cascade of stop-market orders, as this is a line-in-the-sand-type of price level: It’s where the bears previously decided they would no longer sell below that range and where the bulls decided it was a good entry point for long positions. If the $6,450 price levels fail to hold up the market, the next immediate test will be the v-bottom we saw back in February that tested the lower $6,000s. There was a very high level of buyer interest at that level, and it was a level where aggressive short sellers covered and caused a rally. If we manage to break that level, we enter a high likelihood of deeper tests of market support where we will need to zoom out even further on our market view:",1

I'll tell you a terrible secret: in principle, to be aware of fashion trends, it's enough to buy two issues of a favorite magazine a year — September (Spring Winter Trends) and March (Spring Summer Trends). These are the numbers that are considered the main ones, and most of the information in them is not sucked out of their fingers.   With books, it's harder to read books in style, just for interest. Because most of them are either of no use at all or include outdated information. If I find any super-book, I'll tell you. But the books on fashion history can be read. I suggest you start with an encyclopedia. After reading, you will probably be interested in specific designers — read about them separately (VOGUE has a good series).",2

How am I gonna put this in my style? What am I gonna wear this with?   So, what trends I've chosen for myself in the summer of 2016: - pajama style - all kinds of dressings and bananas in the face - open shoulders - blue - double-brown jackets - sarapans on top of T-shirts - wide trousers - vertical strip - tiny flower prince - the punk style elements produce a very long text.

True privacy freaks and anonymity-philes can take things to an extreme level, though. To become untraceable, you could try the following: 1. To use the internet without registering with an ISP, buy an internet hotspot. To prevent any record of you buying it, get a friend to buy it for you, in cash. 2. As soon as you get online, connect to the Tor network. 3. From there, create an email account with an encrypted email service using fake personal information. 4. Then, find a VPN service that accepts payment in cryptocurrency, and sign up for that with your fake email and anonymous payment. Connect to the VPN. 5. Now you can use Tor browser or a secure browser in private mode to surf anonymously. Even with all of these precautions, a dedicated sleuth (or NSA agent) could still find a way to identify you using time lapse between entry or exit nodes.  Pretty extreme, right? The above process would also make for an extremely slow browsing experience. It’s what some whistleblowers, journalists, or those living under oppressive regimes have to do.

The fur coats are bought for more than one season (if you're not rich, of course). When I choose a coat for myself, I would buy a completely basic (a-la robe or straight line), from a hole, without a hood, with sleeves of standard length, with a minimum visible furry (without all this streaky-perlamutarian madness). I'd wear it to a hole. Because it's a classic if you're normal with artificial fur (i.e. I'm normal; and the leopard from the former post is also ) you can buy yourself a perfectly budgeted fur coat. Of course, it's not gonna be hot, but it's the same:) in a trend of coloured fur with a long ox. All that matters is that he doesn't look like a ditched soft toy from his grandmother's antresols.  If the coat is too much for you, buy a fur scarf. They come from natural and artificial furs, too. I really like this genre. Such scarfs look great with a coat. The shoe post will be here soon. I know a lot of people are waiting for him. I'm telling the new guys that I have a second channel. ",2

You will have to pay half in advance so that they can buy CC to use it for carding.   When you pay them the half amount they will go to Amazon, Flipkart website & make the purchase of the item that you require on your address. When it come the page of Payment they will just provide any fake number of credit card which are available on internet & other fake details & proceed to pay.  Now because it takes some time to verify details, Amazon will book the product & mark as Preparing to Dispatch. So they will take this screenshot and send you saying they have done their work and your product will arrive in 4-5 days, now you will have to pay the remaining half. If you don't they say they will cancel the order and will never work with you again.  Because you have seen the screenshot of Amazon, you will believe them and pay them the other half & wait for your product.  But in real, within 30 minutes Amazon will cancel the order because their system has confirmed that payment has not been made yet. Now because they ordered it from their email you won't get this notification of order cancellation.  After 7 days when your product don't arrive you will message them, they say that their job is done..some might ask to wait for more time just for fun & then they all will BLOCK you.  99%  Carders are Fake❌  In my nearly a year on Telegram I have learnt by observing that most (all) channels/person who claims to make you money instantly, by any schemes, Forex-Binary Trading, Paytm hack..etc...They all are scammers  Use Telegram for downloading Movies, Music, Comics, Games, connect with people, and many other things But never use it to become rich overnight or getting expensive stuff at low prices. They all will scam you.  Do forward this message in chats where you can so others can avoid them.

But today I write not only for girls, but also for boys, let's talk about the most basic (in my opinion) part of the basic wardrobe, the white T-shirt. A lot of people think a white T-shirt is boring, and they want to buy something that's so coloured and nice, but just believe me, a white T-shirt is stylish and you have to have it. Of course, not all white T-shirts are equally useful. Let's figure out what the basic white T-shirt should be to take an honorary place in your wardrobe: 1. as simple as possible. free of additional parts, decor, drawings and pristines; 2. direct croya (but not too constrictive) length up to the pelvic bone; 3. cotton of sufficient density. In order to prevent girls from reading underwear and boys from having nipples (pardon); 4. with round cut or shallow v-shaped. The v-cut extends the neck visually and reduces the shoulders (it's just for reference); 5. white base T-shirt does not have to be expensive because it's rather expendable. It's better to have a neat thing on you than a sweetheart. You can buy yourself from a mass market (""Yours"", ""Sela"", ""H&M"""" from 299♪).  What are you wearing? Absolutely with anything, a white T-shirt is a universal thing: just with jeans (of course it's boring, but it's possible), with all the top clothes, with the costumes, with any ""complex"" things, and so on, made for you an endless set of ideas. Today, as I promised, both girls and boys are happy:",2

Suddenly, someone has the same problem, sharing the most basic techniques: • if you wear heels, it's beautiful (there's even a 1 cm rule). heel = -1 kg.) and if you don't wear it, then don't let your shoes contrast with your pants/clothes in color (so you don't dress your leg or make yourself lower and fuller); • I've already written that the larger the Prince, the more likely it will be to fill. So pick a small or give up on it for a while (exclude - vertical strip); • well-paint the dark trousers of the straight rabbit with high/medium landing and arrows; a-silhouette skirts (with the same planting); v-cut or odour clothing; • give up too tight and too free silhouettes (in the first place I feel like a silhouette in a natural shell and in the second I feel like a large cloud). Let your garments flow in the shape; and give preference to dense tissue.

Answer: 1. sleep (it's corny but important); 2. don't drink a lot of water (and not water) at night, so that there's no swelling; 3. do a wetting mask for my face the day before; 4. I'm not gonna write about experiments with skin and hair the day before the shoot (I think you know it's too much); 5. pre-empt an anti-perspirant that doesn't have any marks on my clothes (I'm wearing ""dry dry"" napkins); 6. before shooting, wear free clothes so that there's no sign of panties and underwear on the body; 7. manicure is best made as natural as possible (that's how the hands will look on the photos are snuggled); 8. If you can use the services of a visaist, don't deny yourself the pleasure (I'd like to do it); 9. Let the image be one, but beautiful. If you're a lucky guy and you're having a stylist shoot, you should take with you black and beige smooth bras without bretels (boys, you don't need to) and all your jewelry should be removed and left at home so you don't lose it; 11.

For that, there's got to be a good percentage of wool in its composition, and it's also got to be good on the head. I've already written about the styles a couple weeks ago -- I like hats with hard fields (if you're wondering if you're gonna roll a tape upstairs). I don't advise you to buy a hat without trying it on -- I had a sad experience ordering for Asos. I've seen good options at Zara and Mango from 2000, but you can also try H&M happiness, and remember, the rule of ""receive any hat to any bow and instantly turn into a gas-fashioned fashioner"" has been out of order for a long time.

A diver in the cold of the year can easily replace a shirt — it can be worn on its own or under something (anything:). Guys, you can have divers too, even if you need them; • jumper/winder (this is also an option for men). With a round or v-cut, which one you like best and what goes. You can wear it on your own (but with some bottom of it, of course) and you can wear it under it with a diver or shirt (in which case you can take it off if it gets hot) • a jacket/jacket (suitable for a man and a woman's wardrobe). Very nice if it's made of wool-added fabric. It's better if he's straight, that's how he's gonna be; • cardigan. It's a nice thing (which, by the way, can just be put off at work in the event of a sudden ice age). Special features of a fashion cardigan: direct croi, no clamping, and also good if it's long; • vest. My favorite part of the wardrobe at any time of the year, because it instantly makes the image complete and stylish (and it also builds).

And I advise you to sew it by your standards. It's ideal to have a skirt with a pencil and a vest of the same fabric. Seriously. If this is not possible, then, of course, you can buy the most universal version of the jacket, the straight silhouette, the length to the pelvic bone (plus or minus a couple centimetres), but you can also try on long models.   The ideal trousers are a high/medium landing (to make the legs look longer), the presence of arrows (to make the same legs look thinr), and the length to the ankles. Why the ankles? I'm telling you, this length will allow you to wear your pants with absolutely any shoes. Can you pick longer pants? - you can, but right after you buy it, you're gonna have to make a voluntary decision, which shoes you're gonna wear, by the way, you know what the coolest thing about costumes is? - that you can divide tops and bottoms and create a lot of stylish sets that you don't really want to save on a costume.

Historic parabolic run-ups have, at maximum, retraced to the 78% range before ultimately bottoming. To me, this area is a strong zone of observation and not necessarily a zone of action as the price target of the aforementioned symmetrical triangle is well below that.It’s very important to keep in mind this is all hypothetical and contingent upon the market response to the various support levels. At the time of this article, we are currently testing the strength of the first, initial, crucial support level.Summary:Bitcoin broke down out of a large, multi-month symmetrical triangle. The measured move of this breakout lies roughly between the $1500 - $3000 range. There are various levels of support outlined in this article that all need to considered and analyzed on a case-by-case basis, as they potentially could result in a cryptomarket-wide, devastating downward continuation.

Well, it's not so much easier than trying to be more popular with things that aren't simple, but important. And, of course, it's important that students work independently with what we recommend to them. We carefully select and prepare these materials (example attached to the letter). P.S. We're gonna try to read our course next semester so that the guys who didn't have our course last semester are able to listen to it. But the maximum benefit will still be for those students who have already attended our course last semester. Tremba-Dorn_Gronzova-Dirty will also try to read the course from scratch. But if someone goes to them, who's going to walk us, the effect will increase:) — With respect, Gasnikov Alexander",0

278799,"I love specific questions from readers: ""Good afternoon, Olesia. If you have a chance, please elaborate on the men's silhouette pants with the waist rubber: with and without, with the rubber on the end of the pants (joggers) and without, with the costume cloth or tricutage. Where's the line when the pants of ""quiet"" relatively basic forms turn into ""sports"" of 100% polyester for ""guys from our yard""? What's the top of a pair of pants and what shoes? Can we go out for a walk in town or go to the airport and go somewhere? Or is it the road from home to the gym? ""Thank you."" Answer: ""The most universal jogers are: - costume fabric; - arrows; - no rubber band at the end of the pants; - preferably no bandage on the waist.  You can wear pants like this in almost any situation with clothes and shoes. They're very comfortable. You can usually buy it easy at Massimo Dutti, which I told you about in the last girl's post (it's going to be around 8k, it's going to pay for itself), but there are other shops where they are (sometime the perfect joggers were found by me in Reserved for 1.5k).   The cutting at the end of our pants immediately limits us to a set of shoes (braces/keds). But these pants (if they're not tricottage/polyester) can fit perfectly into the daily ""non-work"" wardrobe. T-shirts/stuffers/cuts may be worn on top.   Tricutors and joggers (may be with a rubber band at the end of a pants or without) — only for relaxing walks and sports — can also be found at the airport:) Combining with sports items and basic Cades/Timberlands.   The polyester joggers, I advise you to choose without a rubber band at the end of your pants, otherwise it's gonna be a fair sport.   I hope she did.",2

278949,"There's been a lot of questions lately from the girls about what to wear to the office in the summer, if the dress code isn't too strict, but you want to look good. I'm telling you, 1. Pliss/a-silhouette/scent skirt. In normal pencil skirts, the summer is often hot and uncomfortable; 2. Bright dicks and light tissue. Choose high-plant models and not too broad; 3. White cotton shirt. Let's just fill it in at any bottom; 4. Tops. Pick the tops from the lung tissue of a straight unseating silhouette. Let there be air between the cloth and the body; 5. It's a straight shirt, it's quite a free rabbit. Pull up your sleeves and fill your shirt downstairs; 6. The vest. A very comfortable thing is an extra layer without onion warming. Choose the vest from the laughter cloth so that it doesn't wiggle hard; 7. A light jacket.

278968,"🗃 Password cracking technique 🗳 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━ There are a number of techniques that can be used to crack passwords. We will describe the most commonly used ones below :  🌀Dictionary attack  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━ This method involves the use of a wordlist to compare against user passwords.  🌀Brute force attack ━━━━━━━━━━━━━ This method is similar to the dictionary attack. Brute force attacks use algorithms that combine alpha-numeric characters and symbols to come up with passwords for the attack. For example, a password of the value “password” can also be tried as p@$$word using the brute force attack.  🌀Rainbow table attack ━━━━━━━━━━━━━ This method uses pre-computed hashes. Let’s assume that we have a database which stores passwords as md5 hashes. We can create another database that has md5 hashes of commonly used passwords. We can then compare the password hash we have against the stored hashes in the database. If a match is found, then we have the password.  🌀Guess  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━ As the name suggests, this method involves guessing. Passwords such as qwerty, password, admin, etc. are commonly used or set as default passwords. If they have not been changed or if the user is careless when selecting passwords, then they can be easily compromised.  🌀Spidering ━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Most organizations use passwords that contain company information. This information can be found on company websites, social media such as facebook, twitter, etc. Spidering gathers information from these sources to come up with word lists. The word list is then used to perform dictionary and brute force attacks. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━  ➖",1

The bigger the Prince, the more likely it's gonna be to fill you up (for someone it's good and for someone it's bad to decide for yourself); 5. white semi-translucent dresses. The more transparent, the more fashionable. But I'm in favour of safe options; 6.. costumes in male style. In a trend of volume models and hypertrophied shoulder lines (but this case can distort the proportions of the figure, so be careful -- you can get rid of the normal two-brace jacket of the straight croy); 7... sports style (by the way, the peak is gonna be a Polo T-shirt). It is important not to forget to dilute it with non-sports; 8. If your overalls were to be locked from the front to the lightning, it's actually fine; 9.

279360,"Perhaps the most frequent question about jewelry that I hear from my clients is, ""Can you combine gold and silver in one image?"" There's no rules on that. To make this image as harmonious as possible, I advise you to build it around a bicolor ornament where there will be gold and silver at once. It can be hard to find these options, but I've made a selection for you from the Poison Drop site:   ",2
279361,"  If anyone doesn't know, I have my own style course in letters. And it's a whole encyclopedia that I collect from my experience with clients: almost 60 detailed letters with pictures of how to choose, wear, combine clothes, become self-confident and beautiful :) And there's news about it.  First, from today to December 27, the first month is only 99 rubles instead of 300 rubles. The perfect price to read for a month and decide whether to stay or not.   Secondly, I wrote a fresh letter about how to gather a birthday dress for a corporat or other reason. And there's gonna be a collection of things from the stores. And if you sign now, it'll be the first to come after the welcome. (If you've already signed it, it will also come out of line.)  After New Year's, I'm likely to raise the cost of the course for the new ones as a whole, so now is the best time to sign, which was at all.............................................................................................................

I don't wear it myself, and I don't advise others (especially guys). There are many other comfortable shoes that look more stylish and fit both skirts and pants: • loafers. Their distinctive feature is the absence of cords; • broggs. These are men's shoes with a perforation; • ponds. On them is always a buckle from the side (or several buckles).

279398,"On Friday, she met the founder of the Ohmycoat Light brand. She offered to give one of my fall webinars a dress-combination. Screwed by individual standards in any length of silk of any color that will be available. (And the price of a combination of 11,800 is that).   Light insisted that I evaluate the quality and landing before I published this post, brought me a sample of the dress. And you know what? It's luxurious. Here's every penny you get. 100% silk, wide open, seams okay. I've never seen such a delicate and neat swing in a similar price category. Lighta told me they're processing the same technology as Hermès. Anyway, it's been a while since I've felt so beautiful about things.   On the webinar, I'm gonna tell you how well I can put this dress in the fall wardrobe, and I'm gonna give all the participants a drink that they can buy for 5,800 or 7,800. If you buy a dress, the webinar itself will get you free of charge (in the sense that the amount of the discount will ""recover"" its cost) Not all things have been taken off, it's better to clarify the existence. You can book it at the director's office. ",2
